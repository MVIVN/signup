# The Odin Project: Sign-up Form
A simple sign up form for an imaginary website.

I'm creating this sign-up form as part of The Odin Project's online web development course curriculum. The sign up form doesn't actually sign you up for anything and no data entered into the form is stored or sent anywhere.
